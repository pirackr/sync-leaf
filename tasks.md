# Task List

This file tracks the high-level tasks required to build the sync application.

## Initial Plan
- [ ] Define the overall project architecture for a folder synchronization app using WebRTC.
- [ ] Implement a basic, cross-platform file watcher with a pluggable interface for future enhancements.
- [ ] Establish a WebRTC data channel to sync files between peers.
- [ ] Add basic authentication for connecting peers.
- [ ] Provide a configuration mechanism to specify folders to sync.
- [ ] Integrate `go vet` and `staticcheck` into the CI pipeline.
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and add a coverage badge to the README.
- [ ] Document setup, usage, and development workflows.

> Tests should accompany each step and be written alongside features.
